The Resistance Front, an offshoot of Pakistan-based, UN-designated, terrorist group Lashkar-e-Taiba, initially claimed responsibility for the attack, which it later retracted. India announced a series of retaliatory measures against Pakistan, including the suspension of the Indus Waters Treaty, prompting responsive measures and leading to a diplomatic crisis and border skirmishes.\\nOn 30 April, Pakistan claimed that a military strike by India was imminent.\\n\\n\\n== Timeline ==\\n\\n\\n=== 7 May ===\\nOn 7 May 2025, India announced that it had launched missile and air strikes, codenamed Operation Sindoor, targeting nine sites across Pakistani-administered Azad Kashmir and Pakistan\\'s Punjab province. The targets in Pakistan-administered Kashmir were targeted by Indian Army\\'s artillery regiment using precision long-range Excalibur rounds and loitering munitions, while the Indian Air Force provided air defence. The Israeli press mentioned Indo-Israeli SkyStriker loitering munitions.\\nThe attacks on targets in Pakistani Punjab were carried out by the Indian Air Force. According to sources cited by India Today, Rafale jets were employed, equipped with SCALP missiles and AASM Hammer bombs. According to a working paper written by Christopher Clary for Stimson Center, BrahMos cruise missiles might have also been used.\\nThe Indian government described the strikes as \"focused, measured, and non-escalatory\". Indian military spokespeople said that the missile strikes targeted infrastructure linked to the terrorist groups Lashkar-e-Taib'),\n",

By 2016, it had become the primary means of Internet communication in regions including the Americas, the Indian subcontinent, and large parts of Europe and Africa.\\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\n\\n=== 2009–2014 ===\\nWhatsApp was founded in February 2009 by Brian Acton and Jan Koum, former employees of Yahoo! A month earlier, after Koum purchased an iPhone, he and Acton decided to create an app for the App Store. The idea started off as an app that would display statuses in a phone\\'s Contacts menu, showing if a person was at work or on a call.\\nTheir discussions often took place at the home of Koum\\'s Russian friend Alex Fishman in West San Jose. They realized that to take the idea further, they would need an iPhone developer. Fishman visited RentACoder.com, found Russian developer Igor Solomennikov, and introduced him to Koum.\\nKoum named the app WhatsApp to sound like \"what\\'s up\". On February 24, 2009, he incorporated WhatsApp Inc. in California. However, when early versions of WhatsApp kept crashing, Koum considered giving up and looking for a new job. Acton encouraged him to wait for a \"few more months\".\\nIn June 2009, when the app had been downloaded by only a handful of Fishman\\'s Russian-speaking friends, Apple launched push notifications, allowing users to be pinged even when not using the app.\\nKoum updated WhatsApp so that everyone in the user\\'s network would be notified when a user\\'s status changed. This new facility, to Koum\\'s surprise, was used by users to ping \"each other with jokey custom statuses like, \\'I woke up late\\' or \\'I\\'m on my way.\\'\"\\nFishman said, \"At some point it sort of became instant messaging\".\\nWhatsApp 2.0, released for iPhone in August 2009, featured a purpose-designed messaging component; the number of active users suddenly increased to 250,000.\\nAlthough Acton was working on another startup idea, he decided to join the company. In October 2009, Acton persuaded five former friends at Yahoo! to invest $250,000 in seed funding, and Acton became a co-founder and was given a stake. He officially joined WhatsApp on November 1. Koum then hired a friend in Los Angeles, Chris Peiffer, to develop a BlackBerry version, which arrived two months later. Subsequently, WhatsApp for Symbian OS was added in May 2010, and for Android OS in August 2010. In 2010 Google made multiple acquisition offers for WhatsApp, which were all declined.\\nTo cover the cost of sending verification texts to users, WhatsApp was changed from a free service to a paid one. In December 2009, the ability to send photos was added to the iOS version. By early 2011, WhatsApp was one of the top 20 apps in the U.S. Apple App Store.\\nIn April 2011, Sequoia Capital invested about $8 million for more than 15% of the company, after months of negotiation by Sequoia partner Jim Goetz.\\nBy February 2013, WhatsApp had about 200 million active users and 50 staff members. Sequoia invested another $50 million, and WhatsApp was valued at $1.5 billion. Some time in 2013 WhatsAp')]"
