Once in a small village named Sundarpur, there lived a boy named Aarav who loved cricket more than anything. Every evening, after school, he and his friends would run to the dusty ground near the banyan tree to play.

One Sunday, the village held its annual cricket match — the biggest event of the year. Aarav’s team, the Sundarpur Strikers, was facing the Riverstone Royals. The whole village gathered to watch.

It was a tight match. In the final over, Sundarpur needed 6 runs from 1 ball. Aarav was on strike. Everyone held their breath. The bowler ran in, the ball flew fast, and — crack! — Aarav swung hard. The ball sailed over the boundary!

Six runs!
The crowd roared. His friends lifted him up in joy.

That day, Aarav became a hero — not just for hitting the winning shot, but for showing that dreams, no matter how small the village, can fly high with passion.
